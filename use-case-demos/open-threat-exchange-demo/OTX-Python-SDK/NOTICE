Modifications made by PuppyGraph in 2025:
- Updated import path for `Retry` (`requests.packages.urllib3.util` -> `urllib3.util.retry`).
- Fixed the logic in `OTXv2.walkapi_iter()` so it correctly stops after yielding the expected number of items.
- Updated `setup.py`:
  - Changed version to `1.5.12+mytest` to differentiate this modified version.
  - Removed `url` and `download_url` fields to avoid confusion.
